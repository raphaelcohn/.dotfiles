# bash only reads .bashrc if the shell is both interactive and non-login
# This is is different to most other shells, like, say, zsh, which reads .zshrc for all interactive shells, login or not
# Hence we source .bashrc from .bash_profile
# We should be sensitive to being re-read (re-sourced)

# This file is read if using a login interactive SSH session.
# However, it may or may not be read otherwise when using ssh: "Bash has a special compile time option that will cause it to source the .bashrc file on non-login, non-interactive ssh sessions. This feature is only enabled by certain OS vendors (mostly Linux distributions). It is not enabled in a default upstream Bash build, and (empirically) not on OpenBSD either."
